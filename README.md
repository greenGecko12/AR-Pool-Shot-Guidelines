# AR Pool Shot Guideline Assistant
This project is an AR application designed to assist pool players by providing visual shot guidelines using an XR (Extended Reality) headset. The app predicts the trajectory of the cue ball based on the angle of the cue and simulates where object balls will travel once they have been struck.

## Features
Cue Ball Trajectory Prediction: Calculate and display the trajectory of the cue ball before a shot is taken.
Object Ball Prediction: Simulate the travel path of object balls after being hit by the cue ball.
XR Headset Integration: Designed to work seamlessly with XR headsets, enhancing the player's view of the table with real-time shot analysis.
More features to come!

## Purpose
This project is developed as part of the 4th year MEng Computer Science degree at the University of Warwick. It aims to leverage AR technologies to help players improve their pool game by offering instant feedback on shot angles and outcomes.
