Sai's TODO list:

Fix the glitch with the guidelines
	-- don't need to show any guidelines when the ball is moving - disable that
	-- ball can't be shot while it is moving
	
Add Damian's model to the Unity scene
	--remember to add holes to the model
	--remember to delete the balls from the scene after they fall through the holes
	--add a tally of how many red and yellow balls have been pocketed at the top of the screen
	
Improve how realistic the simulation is
	--play around with the physics values

Add power setting 
	--Basically a power bar for the cue just like 8-ball pool

Add feature to regen the white ball if it goes off the table

Fix error with the line renderer - it's saying the setpostion index is out of bounds

Position Balls correctly in model
	
Add in the virtual cue stick
	--until then use the Oculus controllers with haptic feedback to show when a shot has been taken
	--remove ability to aim using the mouse (eventually)
	--add ability to shoot (maybe a separate key or something)

Add ability to move around the table - we will need ability to re-orient the table depending on player's position relative to the table
	--using the arrow keys/WASD to move around the camera maybe?
	--don't know how that would interact with Bailey's changes


Add a feature to see how many of each colour have been potted so far at the top of the scene - like a tally

Whenever an inconsistency between simulation and table is detected, update the table state
	--Update after each shot
	--Update after a foul and the player has ball in hand
	

Extension:
	Foul detection?
